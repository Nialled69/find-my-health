    Speaking Points:
        Disparity in organization between government and private hospitals(unorganised health sector) - India cannot progress if its health sector is not organised.
        Over reliance on pen-paper based file systems (Data loss and inaccuracy)
        Lack of transparency from the hospital to the patient's family, where they are not fully informed about everything happening to the patient.
