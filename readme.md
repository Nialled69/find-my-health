Technological solution as per queuing models in OPDs/availability of beds/admission of patients would be one area. Study of dispensation of various types of medicines/consumables and Inventory management modules at hospital level are key areas requiring support. NIC has already developed some modules but their implementation in Delhi is yet to be started. A hospital based solution is ideal which can be integrated with city wide module may be required.
